I no longer see massive game studios as trustworthy, quite the opposite infact.

Another pet peeve of mine is paying for online on console, but there's literally no alternative, since for the same performance PC gaming still requires a higher initial cost of entry, so... Yeah I'm both insanely bummed out that everuthing seems to be i creasongly expensive, but also happy to see a lot of cheap, quickly made but still well polished and FINISHED games be available, even playable on a 10 year old office computer or PS4.

Questi spostamenti sono fatti in modo da massimizzare una metrica di qualità della partizione, come la modularità.\n","\n","Ottimizzazione globale: Dopo una serie di passaggi di ottimizzazione locale, l'algoritmo esegue un'ottimizzazione globale per cercare di ottenere una partizione ancora migliore. Durante questa fase, vengono esplorati cambiamenti più ampi nella partizione dei nodi.\n","\n","Criterio di convergenza: L'algoritmo continua ad eseguire passaggi di ottimizzazione locale e globale fino a quando non si verifica un criterio di convergenza, che può essere basato su un numero massimo di iterazioni o su un miglioramento insufficiente della qualità della partizione.\n","\n","L'obiettivo principale dell'algoritmo Leiden è quello di ottenere una partizione dei nodi del grafo in comunità che massimizzi la modularità o un'altra metrica di qualità della partizione.\n","\n","Per quanto riguarda le formule, la principale metrica utilizzata per valutare la qualità della partizione è la modularità. La modularità misura quanto le connessioni all'interno delle comunità siano più dense rispetto a quelle tra le comunità.

It is literally any and all forms of digital service delivery.  \\n\\nI went down this rabbit hole for a university project a while back. I dug into the policies of a few common services i used every day (email and phone user ID, online grocery service that allows me to order from my phone and pick up goods ready at store, entertainment streaming site and lastly an IM messaging app). \\n\\nThe policies are generally huge and link to other policies. They use generalized jargon and terms that you need to look up unless you have a legal background. One policy generally also allows for data gathering and use by the primary service provider plus also all of its 3rd party affiliates. \\n\\nIt took me a long time, but just focusing on those 4 services above i found that some of them were actually related to each other as affiliates (you would never expect it because they as so vastly different from each other). \\n\\nAt the end of the day, they had access and record of literally everything that determines my place in this world. Full name, surname, middle name, address, contact details in full, banking details in full, list of bank branches i frequently visit in person, list of stores (and even other stores not affiliated with the primary store) that i frequently visit in person, general descriptions of products i buy, foods i buy, foods i avoid possibly due to allergies, brands i buy frequently, brands i avoid, location where i work, details of my insurance providers, details of my close contacts and their contact info,  details of local and even some foreign tourism spots i have visited in the last number of years, details of any medications i have used and may use in future (i think this is speculative based on other bio data). Of course they also had sensitive data like credit card, ID number, drivers license number but those are apparently masked to a greater extent. Most interestingly they also recorded some form of internet browsing history, in addition to device hardware and even software data related to other programs on my devices. It gets weirder when you look into app specific data being captured (distance traveled per day, phone usage per day broken down into subcategories for entertainment/news/commerce, even data and internet usage statistics). The list goes on. \\n\\nMy project got a really good score. It also made me start using a vpn on my phone and pc, which doesnt help against 90% of the stuff above, but to an extent at least obscures some location data (it will never be 100% because of your phone being on the cell network anyway). \\n\\nThere's a ton of data being gathered on all of us every day. I cannot think that half of it has any actual useful use case, at least not directly to the provider gathering it... but that is where 3rd party sale of that data comes in. A whole network of companies doing different things, targeting their products/markets based on trends that come out of that data. \\n\\nI will tell you one thing for sure. If someone with ill intent got a hold of all of that data on me, they can most certainly ruin my life in multiple different ways (identity theft to gain cash, commit crimes, cancel my existing policies/services without me knowing, impersonation with intent to ruin reputation, or go after and harm the people I care about).
