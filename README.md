Starting from 2023 and continuing into 2024, the video game industry has faced massive layoffs. In 2023, over 10,000 jobs were lost, and a further 9,500 layoffs occurred just between January and May 2024 [7]. These layoffs have had resonating effects on both established video game development studios and emerging companies, affecting employees, projects, and the overall landscape of the video game industry. The layoffs have led to the cancellation of several video games, the closure of development studios, or their sale by their parent companies, causing thousands of employees to lose their jobs.

In recent years, unfortunately, layoffs in the video game industry have become increasingly common. In 2023, we witnessed almost weekly layoffs across the sector, and unfortunately, it seems that 2024 will surpass this figure. The video game industry is larger and generates more money than films and music combined, bringing in $180 billion in 2021 alone [9]. It is also a sector that is becoming riskier and more expensive every year, as AAA games require more time and money to be made (around $300 million), leading to a situation where even a single flop can sink a studio or publisher. Additionally, the entire industry desperately needs unions to help protect its millions of workers when things don't go as planned.

Main Causes:
1) Increase in development costs: The costs of developing games are constantly rising, making it more difficult for companies to maintain profitability.
2) Changing consumer preferences: The tastes and habits of consumers are changing, which can make it difficult to predict which games will be successful.
3) Post-pandemic slowdown: The end of the pandemic has led to a decrease in interest in video games, which had seen a boom during lockdown periods.
4) Other factors: Other factors, such as global economic fluctuations and technological innovations, contribute to the sector's precariousness.

After observing the significant impact of layoffs in the video game industry in 2023 and 2024, we posed fundamental questions, imagining that a company had asked us to conduct an analysis to answer the following questions:
- What are the prevailing opinions and sentiments of users regarding the situation in the gaming market in 2024?
- How can user feedback on social media be correlated to the layoffs that occurred at video game companies?
- What are the main concerns and critical issues that emerged from the analysis of comments and online posts?
To answer these questions, we decided to analyze user sentiment expressed on social media like Reddit, then move on to a part of Named Entity Recognition, and finally connect the various comments through graphs, applying the relevant techniques.
